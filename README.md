# Gabriel de Carvalho - Portfolio

A personal portfolio website showcasing my work as a game developer, programmer, and game designer.

## 🎮 About Me

I'm a game developer passionate about programming, game design, and narrative. Since 2022, I've been creating games independently, starting as a 3D artist and level designer in the industry. I learned programming to create my own games, which continues to be my driving passion.

In 2024, I co-founded **Estúdio Calembur**, where I work as a director, programmer, and game designer. We've developed 7 games in game jams (in less than a year!), with two of them receiving awards.
